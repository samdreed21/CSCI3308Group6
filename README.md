Versions: To see the project versions go to the google drive link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7IMzQUjoW9uMndaM1Z5ejFULVE?usp=sharing We needed to use Google Drive because the project is too big.  The project in google drive is over 3GB in size.

Description: As a project group, we have decided to analyze big data like the school grades of University of Colorado Boulder using an interactive data visualization.  We will be using a leap motion controller to make our visualization interactive and an HTC Vive to create an immersive experience.
  The leap motion controller will enable the user to use their hands to gesture, move, modify the visualization and their environment. Our goal is to create a tool for professors and students to easily visualize and compare test scores, FCQâ€™s and other CU Boulder statistics.  We also want to enable the user to easily make various calculations with a drop menu which has a variety of categories, giving the user an option of what they to display.
	
Vision Statement: Bringing virtual reality into our everyday lives.

Risks: The most prominent risk is that only one of us (Catherine) has previous experience working with leap motion. Another risk that may make hitting deadlines difficult is scheduling difficulties. 

Risk Mitigation Plan: In order to address scheduling difficulties we will be using an online schedule planner called Doodle. Because many of us are not experienced with leap motion or unity, we will be using some of the multiple online tutorials to get a good base level of knowledge.

Version Control: Github and Google Drive

Development Method: Agile

Collaboration Tool: We are using Slack for communication and Doodle for scheduling purposes.
